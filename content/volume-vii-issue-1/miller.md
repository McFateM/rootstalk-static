Spanning over a dozen states and provinces, the prairie has succeeded in lodging itself in the hearts of North American poets for centuries. A myriad of plant and animal species make their home in this ecosystem, alongside millions of humans living in cities, rural communities, reservations, and small towns. To this day, writers remain enamored with this emblematic biome for its natural beauty, abundant life, rich history, and diverse population. I created the Interactive Prairie Poetry Module as a small collection of prairie poems, including eighteen works by nine authors.  

The game is also a collage-style writing tool which asks you to navigate the prairie by clicking the left and right arrows at the bottom of the screen. You can read about each area of the prairie and click on bolded text to view poems, and you can also hover the cursor over the text to find hidden glowing lines, then click them to collect poetry. At the end of the game, you can use the lines you’ve collected to piece together your own prairie poem. When you’re done, be sure to save your poem by taking a screenshot or copy-and-pasting it into a separate document.  

The program I used to create the Interactive Prairie Poetry Module is called [Twine](https://twinery.org/). Twine is a free, opensource tool which uses HTML to craft interactive and nonlinear stories in the form of web pages. Learning Twine is easy and requires very little computer science knowledge; anyone can teach themselves the basics with [“A Quick Twine (2.2+) Tutorial” by Allison Parrish](http://catn.decontextualize.com/twine/). When I began this project, I wasn’t sure what shape it would take. I knew I wanted to make poems into an interactive experience, and I knew the basics of what Twine could do. Many of my ideas for the module came later when I read through the complete [SugarCube v2 Documentation](https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/), which lists everything you can do with SugarCube, the free Twine story format I used. As the module became more complex and I found myself wanting to add more and more to it, I ended up teaching myself a fair bit of HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) with the help of free online tutorials from websites like [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) and open community forums like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).  

Over the course of this term, working on the module and reading great swaths of prairie-themed poetry, I came to appreciate the community and commonality that the prairie represents. I chose the poems featured in this game based on their blatant admiration and unabashed honesty regarding this place’s simple virtues and imperfect complexities. These poems and our beloved prairie remind us to find elegance in the simple, the common, the small, and the quiet. They emphasize the connections between people, animals, plants, and the earth as blessings to be celebrated. They capture the smallest moments of beauty, mere murmurs of delicate truth in the tall grass, and hold them under the bright prairie sky for all to see. {{% leaf-bug %}}

Emily Pauline Johnson (1861-1913), also known by her Mohawk stage name Tekahionwake, was a Canadian writer and performer born in Six Nations, Ontario. Her works celebrated her mixed-race heritage — her father was a Mohawk chief and her mother was an English immigrant — drawing from both Indigenous and English influences. She enjoyed canoeing, being on stage, criticizing the government, and fighting for social change.

Sarah Licht is a third-year Grinnell student majoring in English and Psychology, a writer of poems and short stories, and an avid dreamer and gamer. A Florida-native, she would much rather avoid the sunshine altogether and curl up with a good book. When she isn’t writing, she can be found getting another cup of coffee, watching bad movies, or playing with her cat Lilith. In the future, she hopes to publish her own poetry collection and, even more hopefully, several novels. Photo courtesy of Sarah Licht.

Edgar Lee Masters (1868-1950) was an American attorney, poet, biographer, and dramatist. His most well-known work, Spoon River Anthology (1915), is a collection of short poems narrating the epitaphs of the residents of Spoon River, a fictional town named after the Spoon River near his hometown of Lewistown, Illinois. His poetry illustrates rural and small-town American life as it explores themes of community and grief.
