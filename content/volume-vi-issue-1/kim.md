Obesity is a disease involving an excessive amount of body fat and is caused by a combination of factors including behavior, genetics, environment, and education. According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) (CDC), the prevalence of adult obesity was 42.4 percent in 2017-2018.

I made the infographic and drew the icons. The photo of birds above the lake was taken by Jon Andelson. The other images are from Unsplash users as follows: the photo of the man jogging was taken by Markus Spiske; the photo of girls playing in the field was taken by Allison Archer; the photo of soldiers planting was taken by Dmitry Dreyer; and the photo of tap water was taken by Jacek Dylag.{{% leaf-bug %}}
