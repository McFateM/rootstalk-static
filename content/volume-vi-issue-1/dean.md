At every single moment of every single day, the grasslands  are  moving  through  their  cycle  of  life, death, and resurrection, changing from moment to moment.  As  the  Earth  warms  and  cools,  as  the  atmosphere provides or withholds its water, the flora grows, then  withers,  then  reseeds.  Throughout  the  dormant  winter, the soil nurtures roots as microbes provide life energy  to  that  soil,  preparing  the  prairie  for  the  new  grass  shoots  and  wildflower  blossoms  that  will  spring  forth from the old. Prairie is always transforming.

Amidst  this  constant  change,  there’s  a  star  transformer in the prairie firmament: milkweed. As I write, milkweed is having a special moment in our awareness thanks, sadly, to the harrowing decline in the monarch butterfly   population.   Milkweed’s   leaves   provide   the   monarch  caterpillar  with  its  major  food  source  for  it  to  transform  into  the  now-threatened  keystone  pollinator. Other creatures partake of milkweed’s bounty as well.  Bees  and  other  insects  thrive  on  its  nectar.  Even  humans can dine on this generous food source---boiled and  sautéed  milkweed  pods  make  for  some  delicious  vegetables on your summer plate. In fact, humans have transformed  milkweed’s  unique  gifts  into  many  useful  products for centuries---into sweeteners, cordage, insulation, even oil-spill absorbent.  

Summer  brings  milkweed’s  most  stunning  visual transformation. Some varieties explode from their large-leafed  spring  largesse  into  the  heftiest,  showiest  flowers  on  the  prairie.  They  are  also  some  of  the  most  complex blossoms anywhere, with enormous numbers of tiny five-petaled flowers hosting multilayered horns and  hoods  holding  dear  to  uniquely  complex  pollen  sacs.  

Yet I think I enjoy milkweed the most at the end of its annual life, when the pods, or follicles, break open and transform into agents of new life. The plant’s seeds attach to the white filament within the pod and hitch a ride  as  the  silky  threads  take  flight  to  broadcast  milk-weed’s renewal far and wide. But first the emergent silk pauses before embarking on its autumn journey on the wind. It holds tentatively to its mother plant to dance in glistening  streams  of  floss  amidst  the  cool  breezes  before letting go.  

In this most fragile and quiet stage of milkweed’s life, its poetry speaks most beautifully and powerfully to me,  beckoning  me  to  ponder  my  own  possibilities  for  transformation.  

Gossamer of milkweed  
Undressing for winter’s rest.  
\
Will the silken beauty and fragile seed  
  Carry to new life in another place?  
Will the silken beauty and fragile seed  
  Call back the monarch from its brink?  
Will the silken beauty and fragile seed  
  Help us see the wisdom of quiet, gentle renewal?  
\
As it flies from grounded host, floats and dances  
Through warm autumn air sliding toward winter’s cold,  
Where  will  the  gossamer  carry  me  to  seed  and  transform anew,  
To grow again in spring’s reemergence? {{% leaf-bug %}}
