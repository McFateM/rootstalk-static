In addition to a rich and diverse arts culture, the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood in Minneapolis is also home to a diverse immigrant population. One of the larger, if not largest, parts of that population is Somali. With its colorful artwork and murals, cafes, shops and store fronts displaying beautiful Arabic signage, it’s an intriguing and inviting part of the city. It has a culture quite different from midwest Americana—halal meats; malls full of beautifully decorated khimars, abayas, and hijab; small areas with women applying lovely henna tattoos; and cafes with delicious-smelling dishes. Yet, it is also very much a part of the Midwest, with people who experience the same joy and relief over the arrival of spring after a very long winter, and who are happy to banter in agreement. Shop owners invite you in to see their offerings, bolts of fabric waiting to be crafted by expert tailors into the often-colorful clothing worn by many here, and who are happy to answer questions or simply to chitchat. Cedar-Riverside is a small part of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis/St. Paul, with a big love for its culture and uniqueness, and for that we are fortunate.{{% leaf-bug %}}
