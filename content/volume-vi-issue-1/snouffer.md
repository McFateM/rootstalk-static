authorbio: "Artist ***[Linda   Snouffer](https://www.lindasnouffer.com/)***  is   based   in   the   [Twin  Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis%E2%80%93Saint_Paul)  area.  She  came  to  botanical  printmaking  about  a  decade  ago  when  she  watched a leaf printing demo and loved the idea. She made hundreds of cards and small works  of  wreaths  and  other  motif  designs,  then,  when  she  was  looking  to  build  her  landscape composition skills, she connected with  an  artist  who  worked  in  watercolors,  chalk pastels and a fiber art, who ultimately served as her mentor for two years.  
Snouffer has shown and sold her work at numerous Twin Cities galleries, art events, and retail shops. Her commissions have included  works  for  the  [Women’s  Foundation  of  Minnesota](https://www.wfmn.org/), the [Shoreview Branch of the Ramsey County Library](https://www.rclreads.org/locations/SV/), and several Metro Area art collectors.  
She  is  also  in  the  art  business,  assisting  with  exhibit  installation  in  several  Twin  Cities galleries, and taking part in program administration  for  the  [St.  Paul  Art  Crawl](https://stpaulartcollective.org/art-crawl/)   and  [Tangle-town Art Crawl](http://octanecreative.com/tangletown/) .  
Her  work  with  various  non-profit  organizations  centers on environmental causes and women’s social, political,  and  academic  advancement,  and  includes  hundreds  of hours of volunteerism and dozens of original art donations.Snouffer  also  participated  in  a  two-year  mentor  program  with  [Women’s  Art  Resources  of  Minnesota](https://www.thewarm.org/),  which  was completed in 2016. For a deeper dive into her process and work, you can see a brief video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_5bbHyHn2M&feature=youtu.be). "

Botanical printmaking speaks to me and it is the heart of my landscape compositions: apply ink to a leaf, lay the inky leaf on a prepared surface, press it onto the surface; remove the leaf to reveal the ink image left behind.  

Though leaf printing is an uncomplicated process, the  simplicity  is  made  more  complex  by  assimilating  other genres into my work. Using fiber arts, water color, acrylic paint, and chalk pastel, I am able to create intricate,  multifaceted  landscapes  on  tissue  paper,  organza,  and other textiles.  

Grasses  are  used  regularly  in  my  work.  There  are  dozens  of  native  and  cultivar  species,  sizes  ranging  from a few inches to many feet tall. Striking structural variations  in  stalks,  blades  and  seed  tassels  print  with  remarkable artistic versatility. They can be used to represent  cattails,  trees  on  a  shoreline,  or  a  wind-blown  meadow.  The  backgrounds  of  my  pieces  are  a  melding  of  all  the  skills  I  learned  from  teachers  and  mentors.  I  use a wide variety of paper and textile surfaces, including  tissue,  thin  mulberry  paper,  and  heavy  cotton  rag  paper.  Fabrics  include  organza  (bridal  veil  material),  cotton muslin, linen, and sturdy raw canvas.  

All  plant  images  are  made  by  printing  the  actual  plants onto the prepared surfaces. That means to print 36”  Bluestem  grasses,  I  need  to  have  a  surface  that  is  at  least  40-45”  long.  The  biggest  piece  I  have  made  is  “Grass  Lake,”  commissioned  by  a  local  library  which  has  a  nearby  prairie,  affectionately  known  as  Grass  Lake. The piece contains prints of several of the grasses, some of which were five feet in length. The rich history and ecological importance of prairies beckon to be told in  my  art,  opening  the  door  to  “prairie  science  meets  prairie art.” Exhibition artist talks are about prairie science just as much as my artistic process.  

The  short  Minnesota  growing  season  means  time  is limited to print with green plants. Winter studio time requires  ingenuity  and  led  to  developing  new  print-making techniques. Fiber arts adaptations, chalk pastel enhancements,  and  acrylic  overpainting  prints  to  give  texture and definition to winter prints.   {{% leaf-bug %}}
